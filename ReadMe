Project Overview
This project is an Android application currently under development, aimed at creating a language learning tool using SpeechToText, ChatGPT, and TextToSpeech technologies.

Project Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to facilitate language learning by allowing users to engage in conversations with an AI-driven teacher. The application converts spoken language into text, processes the text through ChatGPT to generate responses, and then converts the responses back into speech for the user.

Key Features
Speech to Text: Converts the user's spoken input into text using Google's SpeechToText service.
ChatGPT Integration: Processes the user's text input through OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate conversational responses.
Text to Speech: Converts the generated text responses back into speech using OpenAI's TextToSpeech service, allowing for a seamless conversational experience.
