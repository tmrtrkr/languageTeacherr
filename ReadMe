Project Overview
This project is an Android application designed to demonstrate the MVVM architecture while integrating two different OpenAI APIs and a Google SpeechToText service.

Features
MVVM Architecture Implementation: The project is structured to showcase the MVVM design pattern in an Android environment.
Google SpeechToText Integration: Converts user speech to text using Google's SpeechToText library. An attempt was made to use OpenAI's SpeechToText, but it didn't perform as expected.
Teacher Data Class: This is a class that integrates with an AI model to interact with the user. When a teacher is created, a corresponding Teacher object is instantiated.
Classroom Interaction: When the user navigates to the classroom, the Teacher object is passed as an argument to the fragment. In the classroom, the OpenAI API and several custom services are utilized.
Threaded AI Conversations: A conversation session is managed via an OpenAI thread, where each user message is treated as a session message. The thread ID and assistant ID are used as parameters when calling the OpenAI.run function. This function returns the assistant's response as text.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: The response text is converted to speech using the OpenAI text-to-speech service, and this speech is then played to the user through the ClassRoomModelView.
